"""Electrical-zero (e_zero) calibration: stepped field sweep over one revolution.

Shared by p4gui (configure_tab.py) and puckutility (calibrate_menu.py); keep the
two copies identical.

The older methods aligned the rotor at ONE electrical position (theta = 0 from
both sides, or a +-22.5 deg spin-through around it) and took e_zero from there.
Friction cancels between the two directions, but the encoder's nonlinearity and
cogging at that one spot do not: on a P4-42 single points scatter by +-20 deg
electrical about the true zero, and a calibration from one of them left e_zero
21 deg off (confirmed by the back-EMF of a zero-current coast,
tools/bench/enc_latency_coast.py). Both errors are periodic over a revolution.

So this holds the calibration current on the d axis in phase-voltage-angle mode
and steps the commanded angle through every electrical cycle of one mechanical
revolution, forward then back. Each settled point gives

    e_zero = raw - e_polarity * theta   (mod one electrical cycle, in counts)

and the circular mean over the whole revolution, both ways, averages the
periodic errors out and cancels friction. On the P4-42 it lands within ~1 deg
of the back-EMF zero at 1 A or 2 A.

The same sweep gives e_polarity (the sign of raw travel against theta) and
checks the pole count: one revolution of theta must move the encoder one
revolution. The rotor turns one full revolution each way.
