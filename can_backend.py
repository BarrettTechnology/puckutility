"""Unified CAN adapter factory with runtime auto-detection.

Single entry point (`make_network`) used by both the GUI and CLI. On Windows
the adapter is chosen automatically: if a CandleLight CANable is connected
(USB VID 0x1D50 / PID 0x606F) we use the in-tree CandlelightBus driver;
otherwise we fall back to the existing PCAN path. On Linux both adapter
types appear as SocketCAN interfaces (peak-pcan / gs_usb kernel drivers),
so the dispatch is moot and we keep the SocketCAN call. macOS keeps the
existing PCAN path.

Detection is cheap (a USB enumeration with libusb-package's bundled
backend), so make_network probes every time it's called. If you plug in a
CandleLight after starting the app, the next CAN operation will pick it up
without a restart.
